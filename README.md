# AI-Powered Trust & Safety Platform for Amazon

### A Submission for `< HackOn > with Amazon 5.0` by Team `Ctrl + Alt + Elites`

## üöÄ Elevator Pitch

Our project is an **AI-Powered Trust & Safety Platform** designed to proactively enhance marketplace trust on Amazon. By leveraging a suite of intelligent microservices, we detect fraud, prevent the sale of counterfeit goods, and verify the authenticity of reviews in real-time. Our goal is to create a safer, more reliable ecosystem for millions of customers and sellers.

## üßê The Problem

The rapid growth of e-commerce has created significant challenges that erode marketplace trust:

*   **Fraudulent Activities:** Fraudsters exploit the entire product lifecycle. Payment scams like account takeovers have surged by **131%**, while refund fraud costs an estimated **$24 billion** annually.
*   **Counterfeit Products:** High-profile brands have previously left marketplaces due to the proliferation of fake goods, which harms consumers, damages brand integrity, and causes significant financial loss.
*   **Unreliable Reviews:** An estimated **42% of flagged reviews on Amazon are fraudulent**. Paid reviews, bot-generated ratings, and review hijacking mislead customers, leading to poor purchasing decisions and damaging platform credibility.



## ‚ú® Our Solution

To combat these multifaceted problems, we have developed **three interconnected microservices** that work in concert to build a robust defense for marketplace trust. Each service generates a dynamic score that quantifies risk and trust at different levels of the e-commerce ecosystem.



### Core Microservices

1.  **üë§ User Behaviour & Anomaly Score (UBA):** Identifies suspicious user activity by analyzing account history, IP consistency, review velocity, and linguistic patterns to flag potential bots and manipulators.
    *   **Impact:** Authentic users are given a "verified" status, and the weight of reviews from suspicious users is automatically reduced.
    

2.  **üì¶ Product Integrity Score (PIS):** Ensures a product listing is authentic and accurately described. It analyzes content originality, price deviation, image authenticity (using reverse image search), and aggregated review sentiment to flag potential counterfeits and misrepresented items.
    *   **Impact:** A trust score is displayed directly on the product page, empowering customers to make informed decisions.
    

3.  **üè¢ Seller Credibility Score (SCS):** Assesses a seller's overall trustworthiness based on their fulfillment history, performance, and the average integrity of their products (using the PIS).
    *   **Impact:** Reliable sellers earn a "Verified Seller" badge, differentiating them from high-risk sellers and fostering a healthier marketplace.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This project is built with a modern, scalable architecture designed for real-time processing and analysis.

*   **Frontend:** **Next.js** | **React** | **Tailwind CSS**
*   **Backend:** **Flask** (Python)
*   **Database:** **PostgreSQL**
*   **AI / Data Analysis:**
    *   **Google Cloud Vision API:** For reverse image search to detect stock/copied product photos.
    *   **TextBlob:** For sentiment and linguistic analysis of reviews and descriptions.
    *   **IP-API:** For analyzing user IP addresses for proxies or suspicious locations.
*   **Proposed AWS Architecture:** The system is designed to be deployed on a serverless architecture using **AWS Lambda**, with data stored in **Amazon S3** and **Aurora PostgreSQL**, and ML models managed via **Amazon SageMaker**.

### Architectural Diagram

Our event-driven architecture ensures that any user, product, or seller action triggers a real-time recalculation of the relevant trust scores, allowing for immediate intervention.
